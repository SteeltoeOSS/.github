## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please DO NOT disclose it publicly until we've had a chance to fix it. Please donâ€™t report security vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead head over to [Steeltoe Security Policy](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/security-advisories) and learn how to disclose them responsibly.
